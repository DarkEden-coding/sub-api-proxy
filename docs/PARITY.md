# Compatibility and parity with CLIProxyAPI

The compatibility target is frozen at CLIProxyAPI [v8.0.35](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/tree/ae3ee3be303fb07fb8173279923413005bf32177), commit `ae3ee3be`: the same `config.yaml`, credential files, routes and answers. The source-derived checklist tracks 1,951 contracts and test suites. Moving the reference does not implement those contracts or rerecord existing fixtures.

Most existing fixtures were recorded from the previous reference, `6fecc6e` (v8.0.10). The Claude prompt-cache, prompt-shaping, continuation and error fixtures include selected [v8.0.27](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/tree/bf9341629ef2300ac9d846a2e80fe2756f63a671) changes. Translation between Claude and the OpenAI, Gemini, Interactions and Codex formats follows v8.0.35, with goldens recorded from it, except for three pending pieces: the Gemini-to-Claude responses, the shared tool-argument cleaner and Meta reasoning signatures (`PENDING` in `crates/cpa-translate/tests/golden.rs`). The Claude executor fixtures carry the translated bodies, so they were recorded from `6fecc6e` and v8.0.27 with the four translator commits that change them ([recipe](../crates/cpa-exec/tests/reference/claude/README.md#translator-commits-in-the-recorded-trees)). Those tests retain their provenance; changed Go suites are partial until their current assertions are verified. The [reference update](parity-audit/reference-v8.0.35.md) records additions, retired declarations and count changes. The [upstream inventory](parity-audit/upstream-v8.0.35.md) lists every intervening commit and its porting status. Deliberate differences, including stable caller-system placement, remain in [DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md](DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md).

## What works today

- Client APIs: `POST /v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` (Anthropic), `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/responses` and `/v1/responses/compact` (OpenAI), `/v1beta/models/...` and `/v1beta/interactions` (Gemini), `GET /v1/models`, and the Codex paths under `/backend-api/codex/`. Streaming (SSE) and non-streaming, with format translation between the three protocols.
- Images and video: `POST /v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` through Codex accounts, xAI and OpenAI-compatible upstreams, and the `/v1/videos` and `/openai/v1/videos` routes for xAI video.
- WebSocket: the Responses WebSocket on `GET /v1/responses` and `GET /backend-api/codex/responses`, used by Codex clients, including response steering (`oauth.providers.codex.response-steering`).
- Realtime and live through a Codex account: `/v1/realtime` (WebSocket and WebRTC calls), `/v1/live`, call sidebands and local ephemeral keys (`/v1/realtime/client_secrets`). The WebRTC media relay is an optional build feature (`cargo build --release -p cliproxy --features cpa-server/media-relay`) and is not in the release binaries.
- Providers: Claude (OAuth and API keys), Codex (OAuth and API keys), Kimi, Meta, xAI, Devin, Google Antigravity, Gemini API keys and Gemini Interactions, Vertex AI (service accounts imported with `-vertex-import` or from the dashboard, and API keys), AI Studio (through the `/v1/ws` browser relay), and OpenAI-compatible upstreams such as OpenRouter.
- Account sign-in from the command line or the dashboard: Claude, Codex (browser or device code), Google Antigravity, Kimi, Meta, xAI and Devin.
- Routing: round-robin, weighted and fill-first selection, retries, cooldowns, session affinity, model aliases and exclusions, payload rules, per-credential and global proxies.
- The v8 Management API for configuration, credentials, OAuth sign-in, quota checks (`/requests/api-call`), usage counters, logs and model catalogs, plus the dashboard at `/management.html`.
- HTTPS on the main port (`server.tls`), logging in Go's format to stdout or a rotating `main.log` with Go's per-request access log lines, request log files with client and upstream sections, LAN discovery (`-discover` and the `server.discovery` advertisement), `.env` loading, and remote model catalog updates as in Go (`--local-model` turns them off).
- Plugins (`plugins`, Linux and macOS): loading and configuration, plugin-defined routes, the Management API routes to list, enable, configure and delete plugins, the plugin quota routes, and the HTTP, auth, affinity and model host callbacks. Model callbacks run through the ordinary dispatcher with inherited credential pins, execution sessions and request paths, and stream executor payloads before HTTP framing. Plugin model catalogs bind to credentials of their provider (with the credential's excluded models applied), and plugin executors serve those credentials without a model router; plugin `auth.parse` and `model.for_auth` are not used yet. Native plugins load from content-addressed shadow copies, which keep source artifacts replaceable, and loaded images remain resident after logical unload; the copies live in a per-user directory under `$TMPDIR` ([DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md](DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md)).
- Home mode (`-home-jwt`): bootstrap, config updates, request dispatch, usage, process and request logs, in-flight reporting and shared KV state. Home-managed plugin sync, tasks and status reporting remain unavailable.
- The `PGSTORE_*`, `OBJECTSTORE_*` and `GITSTORE_*` storage backends, and the Redis-protocol usage subscriber on the main port.
- Config and credential files are watched and reloaded without a restart. A plaintext management key is hashed on first start, as Go does.
- The separate, optional `observability.pprof` listener follows Go v8.0.35 for startup, reload and shutdown, including active requests continuing after a drain timeout without starting a replacement until another config publication. Temporary accept errors retain the listener and back off. Its index, command line and symbol routes are always available when enabled. CPU profiles require the non-default `cpa-server/pprof` build feature on Unix; published release binaries exclude it and return no resolved symbol names. Go runtime profiles return plain-text `501` answers, as approved in [DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md](DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md).

The dashboard says when the server lacks an endpoint instead of failing: actions it cannot do are disabled and named, and pages it cannot load say which route is missing. What is still missing is listed under [Upcoming features](../README.md#upcoming-features), and the deliberate differences from Go are in [DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md](DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md).

## Where it stands

<!-- parity-summary:start -->
Audit of 2026-10-20 (v0.2.6, d1261f2) against CLIProxyAPI v8.0.35 (`ae3ee3be`).

| Milestone | Items | Covered | Partial | Missing |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| M1 | 151 | 54 | 83 | 14 |
| M2 | 189 | 98 | 87 | 4 |
| M3 | 424 | 191 | 211 | 22 |
| M4 | 589 | 244 | 330 | 15 |
| M5 | 331 | 198 | 123 | 10 |
| M6 | 267 | 121 | 129 | 17 |
| All | 1951 | 906 | 963 | 82 |
<!-- parity-summary:end -->

An item is covered when it is implemented and a Rust test or a fixture recorded from the Go server checks it. Partial means it works but not every case is pinned by a test, or only part of it is implemented; most partial items are Go test files whose behaviour other tests cover without porting each case. Missing means it is not implemented. A deliberate difference from Go, listed in [DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md](DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md), counts as covered.

## What each milestone covers

| Milestone | Scope |
|---|---|
| M1 | Claude: OAuth sign-in, Messages passthrough, request shaping, model catalogs and client keys |
| M2 | Translation between the OpenAI Chat, Completions and Responses formats, Gemini and Interactions, and Claude |
| M3 | The other providers: Codex, Antigravity, AI Studio, Vertex, Gemini keys, Kimi, xAI, Meta, Devin and OpenAI-compatible upstreams |
| M4 | Routing and operations: account selection, cooldowns, retries, payload rules, aliases, proxies, logging and the shared config |
| M5 | The Management API, WebSockets, realtime and live voice, and access control |
| M6 | Plugins, the terminal UI, LAN discovery and Home (cluster) mode |

Missing items now also include v8.0.35 speech routes, SIWC, tool search, model catalog sources, new configuration and plugin contracts. Plugin runtime integration and parts of Home remain incomplete. The plugin store and terminal UI exist, though some Go cases remain unported.

Antigravity (M3) is implemented: sign-in from the command line, the dashboard and the Management API, the executor, AI credits, connection pool settings, reasoning replay and the web-search capability probe. The executor features have Go-recorded tests with local mock upstreams; sign-in is tested against local mock endpoints. Selected v8.0.27 changes add Claude 5.5 models, CAQS thinking signatures and backend errors inside streams. This is not full v8.0.35 parity: model entitlements, session continuation, newer schema and usage fixes, and several suites remain unported. [DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md](DIFFERENCES-FROM-GO.md#antigravity) and the upstream inventory list them. No live Antigravity account has been used in these tests.

The audit combines a source scan with saved route probes and manual judgments. Rerunning it reuses those saved probes and judgments. Live-provider compatibility needs separate testing. Counts can lag runtime wiring; a method implemented in a host library may still be unused by the server. The feature descriptions above follow the server's actual call paths.

## The audit files

Everything behind the numbers is in [`docs/parity-audit/`](parity-audit):

- [`checklist.md`](parity-audit/checklist.md) lists every item with a link to the Go source it comes from.
- [`status.md`](parity-audit/status.md) gives each item its status, the evidence (the Rust code and tests that cover it) and a note.
- [`manual.tsv`](parity-audit/manual.tsv) holds the judgments made by reading code, with their evidence.
- [`audit.py`](parity-audit/audit.py) rebuilds `status.md`, the table above, and the README parity sentence from the same totals. [`probe.py`](parity-audit/probe.py) starts the binary and requests every route in the checklist with a private test configuration, to see which ones are routed; its results are in `routes.json`.
- [`verify_reference.py`](parity-audit/verify_reference.py) checks the frozen checklist's IDs and retained text, test declarations, routes (method and full path), config leaves, CLI flags, RPC methods and citation bounds against a read-only Go clone. It does not establish Rust behavior coverage.

Run `python3 docs/parity-audit/audit.py` from the repository root after a change to refresh all three. The [v0.2.6 rebaseline](parity-audit/rebaseline.md) records the review against `6fecc6e`; the [v8.0.35 reference update](parity-audit/reference-v8.0.35.md) records the new target's inventory and count changes.
